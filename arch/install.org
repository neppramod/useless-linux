* Partition
** Use ~cfdisk~ command to create partitons. For virtualbox, you may want to create partitions for /boot (500M), swap (1.5G) and root (rest of partition). Use around 15G dynamic drive.
** To Format the drives use following commands (Assuming /dev/sda1 as /boot, /dev/sda2 as swap and /dev/sda3 as root).
